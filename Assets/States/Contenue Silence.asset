  gameText: You contenue the silence. After a while, you notice that the bus had
    skipped your stop. You end up waiting until a second round, watching the stranger
    leave. Congradulations, you now leveled up from a grandmaster introvert to an
    expert hermit. You do like crabs though, it might not be a bad thing. Enjoy your
    phone, you earned it. Press [1] to end
