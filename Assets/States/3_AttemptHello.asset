  gameText: You attempt to say hello. Instead of a hello, a quiet and squeaky "hey"
    (yet the stranger still noticed). He just stares quietly in confusion. Later
    on, there is a racoon that is wearing three sets of coats. Do you bring this
    up as small talk[1] or do you contenue the silence[2]?
