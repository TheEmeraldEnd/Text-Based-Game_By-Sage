  gameText: You start to question the logic behind this, but you start to run away.
    You expect the guy to run after you, but after one look, he isn't no where to
    be seen. You are now embarassed, maybe. You think you might be controlled, like
    some sort of game. But that can't be true. It might jut be the tiredness. You
    enjoy a good night. Press [1] to end.
