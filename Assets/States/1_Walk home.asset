  gameText: It's a nice summers day. The nice city walks are blooming with lifeless
    trash this time of year. Streets bustling with the wildlife of racoons and street
    rats. Nothing out of the ordinary. Today, you feel something different. You can
    contenue your path down to the house [1] or take the scenic route through the
    suspicously peaceful park way [2].
