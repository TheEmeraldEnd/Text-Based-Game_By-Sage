  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  gameText: You attempt to redirect the conversation. Instead of racoons, you reach
    for the panic button and splurt out "Pigeon!" He is justly confused and in all
    honesty, so is the narrarator. Luckily, the narrarator is also the bus driver,
    so you go home just as you say "Pigion." [1] press to end.
